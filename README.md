# 📣 Marketing Channel Efficiency

| Channel       | Sessions | Orders | Revenue ($) | Conversion Rate | Revenue per Session |
|--------------|----------|--------|------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Direct       | 83,328   | 6,118  | 371,433    | 7.34%           | $4.46              |
| Paid Search  | 378,858  | 25,852 | 1,544,817  | 6.82%           | $4.08              |
| Paid Social  | 10,685   | 343    | 22,259     | 3.21%           | $2.08              |

- Paid Search drives scale.
- Direct delivers highest efficiency.
- Paid Social underperforms and requires optimization.

Only **6.8% of total visitors complete a purchase**, with major drop-offs between the product page and checkout stages. Funnel optimization presents the largest opportunity for revenue improvement without increasing traffic spend.

# 🧸 Product Performance
